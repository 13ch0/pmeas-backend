# GPIO Installation Instructions

The PMEAS system supports loop machine functionality to allow the musician to record an audio stream and play it in a live loop. Multiple loops can be stacked on top of one another for more complex compositions. To use the functionality, however, physical components must be added to the system to make the experience as close to a physical pedal as possible. Naturally, the use of GPIO is a necessity for the functionality of the loop machine. These instructions show you how to hook up the physical components to enable loopback.

### Hardware Required
* Hardware device with GPIO pins (in this example, a Raspberry Pi will be the target device)
* Female to male pins
* Breadboard
* Stompbox
* LED light

### Installation Procedures
> Before connecting any components to the device, ensure it is powered off to avoid shorting the device
